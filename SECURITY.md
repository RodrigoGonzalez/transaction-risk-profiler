## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability within the
"transaction-risk-profiler" project, please report it to us by
sending an email. Here's how to do it:

### How to Report

1.  **Compose an Email**: Write an email detailing the
    vulnerability. Be as specific as possible, including steps to
    reproduce the issue, the expected outcome, and the actual
    result.

2.  **Set the Subject**: Use the following subject line for your
    email: ``GitHub Repository Security Issue Found:
    transaction-risk-profiler``. This will help ensure that your
    email is handled promptly.

3.  **Send to the Correct Address**: Send the email to
    [r\[at\]rodrigo-gonzalez.com](mailto:r@rodrigo-gonzalez.com)

4.  **Wait for a Response**: We take security issues seriously
    and will review your email as quickly as possible. You can
    generally expect an acknowledgment within 48 hours, but it
    may take longer depending on the complexity of the issue.

5.  **Follow-Up Communications**: We will keep you updated on the
    status of the issue and inform you whether the vulnerability
    is accepted or declined. If accepted, we will work towards
    resolving it and may reach out for additional information if
    needed.

### What to Expect

-   **Acknowledgment**: We strive to acknowledge receipt of your
    vulnerability report within 48 hours.

-   **Updates**: You can expect periodic updates on our
    investigation and progress at least once a week.

-   **Acceptance or Decline**: Once we have concluded our
    evaluation, we will inform you whether the vulnerability has
    been accepted or declined. If accepted, we will work on a
    fix. If declined, we will provide an explanation.

Please note that this process is intended for reporting security
vulnerabilities only. For general issues, questions, or support,
please use the GitHub Issues feature in the repository.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability
before we have had a chance to investigate and respond.
Responsible disclosure helps protect the community and ensures
that vulnerabilities are handled in a way that minimizes risk.

### Questions or Concerns?

If you have any questions or need further guidance, please don't
hesitate to contact us via
[r\[at\]rodrigo-gonzalez.com](mailto:r@rodrigo-gonzalez.com)
or by leaving a comment on the issue you've created.

Thank you for helping to keep the project secure!
